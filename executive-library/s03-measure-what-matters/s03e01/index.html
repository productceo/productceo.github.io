            <p>Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework is widely used in the technology industry for setting objectives and tracking progress. The OKR framework earned its fame after Google in its infancy has adopted the method to brings its projects into order. In Measure What Matters, John Doerr, the man who brought the framework to Google, explains the OKR framework.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-okr-and-its-predecessors">History of OKR and Its Predecessors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scientific Management (Taylor-Ford Model): Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford were the first to measure output systematically and analyze how to get more of it. They held that the most efficient and profitable organization was authoritarian.</li>
<li>Management by Objectives (MBO): Peter Drucker believed Taylor-Ford Model is not fit for knowledge work. Drucker wrote that a corporation should be a community built on trust and respect for the workers, not just a profit machine. He urged subordinates be consulted on company goals.</li>
<li>HP Way and iMBO: HP and Intel adopted Peter Drucker’s MBO and called it, respectively, HP Way and iMBO (Intel MBO). iMBO, by Andy Grove, amended MBO by tracking key performance indicators.</li>
<li>Objectives and Key Results (OKR): John Doerr learnt iMBO from Andy Grove, renamed it to OKR, and applied it to his portfolio companies at KPCB, including Google.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-okr-is-and-what-okr-is-for">What OKR is and What OKR is for</h2>
<ul>
<li>OKR is “a management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization”.</li>
<li>OKRs give visibility into an organization and a productive way to push back.</li>
<li>OKR is meant to be shared with all other employees in the organization. The lowest ranking contributor can see everybody else’s OKRs up to the CEO (and more importantly, horizontally in other teams).</li>
<li>Once set, progress in regard to OKRs should be checked at least once a quarter. Google checks once a month.</li>
<li>OKR is flexible. It is not meant to be a financial commitment or a weapon against an employee in their performance review. If this is not clarified, teams will resort to unambitious OKRs or waste time looking for the perfect OKRs.</li>
<li>At any point in cycle, for any Os or KRs, the team can perform any of four operations:
<ul>
<li>Continue: If team is on track and goal is not broken, then don’t fix it.</li>
<li>Update: Circumstance has changed and OKR needs to be revised consequently. This includes schedule and priorities.</li>
<li>Start: Launch a new OKR mid-cycle whenever the need arises.</li>
<li>Stop: When a goal has outlived its usefulness, drop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>John Doerr sets OKRs quarterly, and starts brainstorming Q2 OKRs midway through Q1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-set-objectives-and-key-results">How to Set Objectives and Key Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>An objective is what is to be achieved. Objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and inspirational. They’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution.</li>
<li>Key results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. They are measurable and verifiable. You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t; there is no gray area.</li>
<li>Objectives are compared to principle and vision. Key results are compared to practice and execution.</li>
<li>Less is more. There should be only three to five objectives per cycle, and each objective should be tied to three to five key results only.</li>
<li>“All key results are completed” must be equivalent to “objective is achieved”.</li>
<li>Non-Numeric KRs are allowed: Marissa Mayer reportedly said, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number”, but John Doerr’s definition of KR, or the best practice examples from KPCB portfolio companies, Intel, and Google, have key results that are not numeric. However, John Doerr’s definition of KR and best practice examples from KPCB portfolio companies, Intel, and Google, allow KRs that are binary achievements (e.g. “Release X” or “Complete Migration”), and I believe adopting that flexible definition of KRs will make it easier for us (Bing MM) to ensure that “achieving every KR” is equivalent to “achieving the associated O”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-ambitious-okrs">Setting Ambitious OKRs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goals should be challenging.</li>
<li>Edwin Locke, a psychology professor at University of Maryland who influenced Andy Grove, published that hard goals drive performance more effectively than easy goals, and specific hard goals produce a higher level of output than vaguely worded ones.</li>
<li>If you are certain you are going to nail a key result, you’re not pushing yourself hard enough. “OKRs are big, not incremental. We don’t expect to hit all of them. If we do, we’re not setting them aggressively enough.” (Google OKR Playbook).</li>
<li>“You are not supposed to strive for greens on every OKR you write. . . It took courage to write an OKR that might fail, but there was no other way if we wanted to be great.” (Sundar Pichai).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-okrs-up-and-down-in-the-organization">Setting OKRs Up and Down in the Organization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Top Down and Bottom Up</li>
<li>Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encouraged to create at least half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. When all objectives are set top down, motivation is corroded.
<ul>
<li>An optimal OKR frees contributors to set some of their objectives and most or all of their key results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some, but not all, key results at a level become objectives at the level below. (Note that key results, not objectives, become objectives of the level below).
<ul>
<li>When all objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise. Tightly cascading organizations tend to resist fast and frequent goal setting. Even minor updates can burden downstream. Tight cascading locks in vertical alignment, but is not effective in connecting peers horizontally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remind, a KPCB portfolio company, involves team members in voting on their quarter’s top objectives in order to ensure that OKRs are not just top down.</li>
</ul>
