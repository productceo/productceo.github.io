            <h2 id="components-of-the-organizational-capabilities">Components of the Organizational Capabilities</h2>
<p>The capabilities of the organization is not the same as the capabilities of the individuals in the organization. The organizational capabilities framework states that three classes of factors affect what an organization can and cannot do: its resources, its processes, and its values.
Resources include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brand, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually assets that can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or enhanced. Transferring resources is easier than transferring processes or values.
Processes are patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision-making. Organizations use processes to transform inputs of resources into products and services of greater worth. Through processes, organization carries out manufacturing, product development, procurement, market research, budgeting, planning, employee development and compensation, and resource allocation.
Values are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made. A company’s values must reflect its cost structure or its business model. If a company’s overhead costs requires it to achieve gross profit margins of 30 percent, then the organization is incapable of commercializing projects targeting low-margin markets.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-organizational-capabilities">Evolution of Organizational Capabilities</h2>
<p>In a startup, much of what gets done is attributable to its resources: its people. Addition or departure of few key people can have a profound influence on its success. Over time, the locus of the organization’s capabilities shifts toward its processes and values. At a successful firm like McKinsey and Company, the processes and values have become so powerful that it almost doesn’t matter which people get assigned to which project teams.
An organization encodes its recurrent tasks into its processes and its business model into its values. Processes and values over time become the culture of the organization. If a startup fails at this, it will become a one-time success at best. If it succeeds, it will become an enduring organization producing success after success. However, culture is stable. It defines what an organization can and cannot do.</p>
<h2 id="acquiring-new-organizational-capabilities">Acquiring New Organizational Capabilities</h2>
<p>New problems require new organizational capabilities to solve. Changing resources, including its people, is easy. However, changing processes and values, especially when they have become embedded in culture, can be incredibly difficult.
There are three options through which to create new organizational capabilities that an organization needs for a new task.
First option is to acquire a different organization whose processes values match the new task. A company may acquire another company either for its resources or for its processes and values. If the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain new resources, then the acquiring manager should integrate the acquisition target into the new parent organization such that the acquired resources can leverage the existing capabilities of the parent organization. However, if the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain new processes and values, then the acquiring manager should not integrate the acquisition target into the parent organization.
Second option is to transform the existing organization. However, changing processes is very difficult, because the structure of the current organization was designed in the past specifically to facilitate the current processes. Furthermore, existing organization must continue to carry out the current business activities which it cannot do effectively if it abandons the processes it built for them.
Third option is to create an independent organization with new processes and new values. For this to succeed, the new organization must have access to the resources of the mainstream organization, but its projects should not be put in competition against the projects of the mainstream organization for resources.

The amount of size and autonomy that the new spin-off organization needs depends respectively on how different its processes and values have to be from the existing organization.</p>
