            <h2 id="disruptive-technology-redefines-performance-metrics">Disruptive technology redefines performance metrics</h2>
<p>Blindly following the maxim that good managers should keep close to their customers can be a fatal mistake. Sustaining technologies improve a product’s performance measured by metrics on which existing customers and companies have placed value. Disruptive technologies on the other hand may even regress a product’s performance on traditional metrics in order to improve on a new different metric that often only a small number of low-profitability customers value today.
In the computer storage industry, established firms were consistently leading innovators in developing risky, complex, and expensive sustaining technologies that maximized capacity (bytes per dollar). Capacity is what their best customers, minicomputer manufacturers, valued most.
During that time, disruptive firms invented 5.25-inch architecture disks. Although 5.25-inch disks were smaller than the dominant 8-inch disks, they did not meet the perceived needs of the minicomputer manufacturers, because 5.25-inch disks were more expensive than the 8-inch disks at the same capacity volume. Consequently, well-managed established storage disk manufacturers decided not to introduce their own 5.25-inch disk products.
However, 5.25-inch disks did meet the needs of the personal computer market that was small and had low profit margin at first, but emerged rapidly. Soon, 5.25-inch architecture matured and even the minicomputer manufacturers wanted it, but the established disk companies could not catch up with the upstarts who had more experience with the technology.

Established companies sometimes delay the introduction of a new disruptive technology out of fear that the new technology would cannibalize the sales of their existing products. However, new technologies are often not initially cannibalistic. If the established companies wait until the new technology becomes commercially mature and their home market is attacked, then the fear of cannibalization becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<h2 id="three-possible-explanations-for-why-great-companies-fail">Three possible explanations for why great companies fail</h2>
<h3 id="incorrect-organizational-structure-or-technological-capabilities-as-explanations">Incorrect: Organizational structure or technological capabilities as explanations</h3>
<p>One way to explain why great companies fail is by using organizational and managerial explanations of failure. Henderson and Clark posit that organizational structures of most companies facilitate component-level innovation, because their product development organizations consist of subgroups that correspond to a product’s components. Such system works very well as long as the product’s fundamental architecture does not require change. But when architectural technology change is required, this type of structure impedes innovations that require people and groups to communicate and work together in new ways. An organization chooses a structure to facilitate the design of its dominant product, but the structure it chooses determines the way it can and cannot design new products.
Another way to explain why great companies fail is by using capabilities and radical technology as an explanation. Clark, then Cushman, Anderson, and their associates, found that firms failed when a technological change destroyed the value of competencies previously cultivated, and firms succeeded when new technologies enhanced them.
However, in the disk drive industry, industry leaders were the first to introduce sustaining technologies of every sort, including architectural and component innovations that rendered prior competencies irrelevant and made massive investments in skills and assets obsolete. Therefore, the early two theories cannot be sufficient explanations for their failures.</p>
<h3 id="correct-value-networks-as-an-explanation">Correct: Value networks as an explanation</h3>
<p>Value network is the context within which a firm identifies and responds to customer needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for profit. The way value is measured differs across networks. The unique rank-ordering of the importance of various product performance attributes defines the boundaries of a value network.
In the disk drive industry, we saw two value networks. In the mainframe computers value network, disk drive performance was measured by capacity, speed, and reliability. In the portable computers value network, disk drive performance was measured by ruggedness, low power consumptions, and small size.
This example shows that parallel value networks, each differently defining what makes a product valuable, may exist within the same broadly defined industry. A disruptive technology gets its commercial start in emerging value networks before invading established networks.</p>
