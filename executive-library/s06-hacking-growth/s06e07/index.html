            <h2 id="retention-makes-and-breaks-a-business">Retention Makes and Breaks a Business</h2>
<p>Peter Drucker asserted that the purpose of business is to create and keep a customer. A business which fails to keep its customers, no matter how many customers they acquire initially, is doomed to fail. One such example is Homejoy. Homejoy was an online marketplace for home cleaning services founded by Adora Cheung who is now a partner at Y Combinator. Despite once being “the fastest growing Y Combinator company” raising $40 million in total and expanding into 35 cities, Homejoy ultimately shut down, because most of its customers did not convert to paying the full price after the first cleaning promotional discount.</p>
<p>Amazon, in contrast, is the prime (pun intended) example of customer retention. 73% of Amazon Prime free trial subscribers convert to paying subscribers at the end of their free trial year (conversion rate), and 96% of Amazon Prime members who have been subscribers for two years renew into their third year (renewal rate). Not only are their retention rate unheard of in the industry, their customer retention rate also increases as the time customers have been on their platform increases. Retention Hacking is a methodical approach to creating an Amazon rather than a Homejoy.</p>
<h2 id="evernotes-smile-graph-and-the-stored-value-effect">Evernote’s Smile Graph and the Stored Value Effect</h2>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxchen/frankc/master/2014%20July/evernote-smile-graph.png" alt="Evernote Smile Graph">
Evernote visualized their returning users into what they call a “Smile Graph” to show that the longer customers use Evernote, the more likely they are to continue using it. This is because of the stored value effect. A user’s stored value in Evernote increases as the user adds more personal notes to their Evernote notebook. Even if a competitor launches a superior note taking application the next day, a long time Evernote users will be unlikely to defect, since they can only search their past notes on Evernote. To achieve customer retention, the product should be purposefully designed such that its value to customers increase as they continue using the product.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.twipemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hookCanvas-990x681.png" alt="The Hook Canvas">
Generalizing this concept into a concrete theory, Nir Eyal proposed the Hook Model in his book Hooked. Hook Model proposes there are four levers that a business has control over in customer interaction with the product: trigger, action, reward, and investment. External trigger, such as push notification, and variable reward are tactical devices the business can plant in a product to see immediate improvements, whereas reducing the actions required for users to see the reward and increasing the actual reward are strategic investments that will slowly but surely result in higher customer retention.</p>
<h2 id="managing-retention-over-time">Managing Retention Over Time</h2>
<p>Brian Balfour posits that retention happens in three stages. During the initial retention period, product should clearly show the value to the customer. During the medium retention phase, novelty fades and the product is pressured to demonstrate a fundamental utility. During the long-term retention phase, product must continuously refresh the customer’s perception of the product as a must-have.</p>
<p>The key is understanding customer retention as a never-ending effort, but with changing objectives. One implementable advice that results as an outcome of this perspective is ongoing onboarding. Ongoing onboarding is a developmental process that teaches users how to use the product, first with simple objectives, then toward a mastery incrementally over time. Each tutorial session should be manageable, yet lead the user from being new to the product, familiar with basic functionalities, then efficient in reaping the product’s full potential.</p>
<p>Video games were early to the study of tutorial design such that users are motivated to continue learning. Yelp used gamification in the Elite Status program in which it rewarded its most engaged users with a publicly displayable Elite badge on their account profile, thereby giving them a sense of pride to be a power user on Yelp. Companies that implement gamification must be careful not to hand out such badges without any concrete utility to the users. On Yelp, an Elite badge not only gave the user a stronger credibility in their reviews, the badge also acted as an exclusive invitation or early entrance to Yelp events.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-retention">Measuring Retention</h2>
<p>It is important to choose the correct metric for measuring retention in your industry. For example, the metric of retention in the e-commerce industry is repurchase rate of customers. Optimizing for a different metric, such as daily active users over monthly active users (DAU / MAU) which is the metric of retention in the social network industry, could lead the product to being popular without being successful.</p>
<p>Cohort analysis helps the business identify and strategize for target user segments. In a cohort analysis, users are split into various subgroups based on identifiable patterns such as their demographic background. Then, the business measures and analyzes how different cohorts behave differently.</p>
<p>As a final note on customer retention, customers who stopped using the product are not lost customers. The company should understand why the users left the product, identify the problems that are in the product team’s control to address, then review the importance of winning the “zombie customers” back in context of retaining current customers and bringing new ones. When the team is ready to win back the zombie customers, the team should prepare a resurrection flow for the returning users. The resurrection flow is a separate user experience for the customers who have been inactive on the product for a specified amount of time that is designed to remind them of the aha moment on the product.</p>
<h2 id="more-from-the-authors-themselves">More from the authors themselves</h2>
<p>If you are interested in implementing growth hacking methodology at your own company, you can get a copy of Hacking Growth on Amazon, or visit the GrowthHackers website, which is run by the authors themselves, to discuss with other product leaders who are applying growth hacking to their businesses.</p>
