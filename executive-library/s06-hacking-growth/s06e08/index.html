            <p>To reward the employees and shareholders who believed in the business and to fund the next generation of products for the customers, the business needs to secure profit. To earn profit, the business needs to earn revenue. Monetization is the process of discovering opportunities and realizing revenue.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-opportunities">Discovering Opportunities</h2>
<p>There are multiple viable approaches to finding monetization opportunities. The top down approach is looking for pinch points. Pinch points user interactions with the product where potential earnings are not being realized. The bottom up approach is analyzing the users. In a cohort analysis, the business segments customers into cohorts with shared backgrounds, such as age groups. The goal is to find the average revenue per user for each cohort, then prioritize the cohorts to address in product development and marketing. While cohort analysis yields informative statistics, human brain is better at processing concrete narrative stories rather than statistics. Therefore, the product teams should build user personas which are profiles of hypothetical people who represent each cohort group’s simplified characteristics and stereotypes. By thinking through how a concrete user persona may interact with the product, the company can finally develop strategies for product design and marketing.</p>
<h2 id="pricing-strategies">Pricing Strategies</h2>
<h3 id="consumer-psychology">Consumer Psychology</h3>
<p>There are simple pricing strategies like choosing an arbitrary charm price. A charm price is a price that ends with a 9, 99, 98, or 95, and is often used to make the price of a product look more attractive to customers than it really is. Charm prices, since the concept had been proposed by William Poundstone in his book Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value, have been used to sell all kinds of products from Safeway carrots to Apple iPhones.</p>
<p>Another choice is going for a high price. Thorstein Veblen, in his book The Theory of the Leisure Class, noted that the demand for luxury goods actually increases as the price increases. This pricing effect is called Veblen Effect today. Charging more for a product can make the product more appealing to customers who are looking for best-in-class products.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is making the product freemium. The concept of penny gap describes the infinitely bigger difference between $0.00 and $0.01 than between $0.01 and $0.02. Among top 50 highest grossing games in Apple App Store, not a single one is pay-up-front. They are all free-to-play with in-app-purchase features. To build a freemium product, the business can provide premium features to paying customers while providing basic features to new customers such that the new customers can be shown benefits of premium features. An example is Coffee Meets Bagel which sells a virtual currency to customers who want the premium feature of getting a second chance with missed matches.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-experiment">Pricing Experiment</h3>
<p>The business can also arrive at a good price through scientific experimentation, much like how most product design and marketing are optimized through A/B testing today. To find the customer willingness to pay, ask customers the following four questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>At what price point does this product become too expensive that you’d never consider purchasing it?</li>
<li>At what price point does this product start to become expensive, but you’d still consider purchasing it?</li>
<li>At what price point does this product start to become a really good deal?</li>
<li>At what price point does this product start to become too cheap that you’d question the quality of it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you convert the responses into four lines corresponding to (percent of respondents, price point) for each of the four questions, you will find that the four lines draw a diamond in the middle. The resulting diamond in the middle is called the experiment zone, and reveals a range of prices that the business should consider and test for their product.</p>

Combine pricing research with feature research to create the persona pricing fit, building out product plans and pricing that meets needs and expectations of the key target customers. Some companies also experiment with dynamic pricing in which price varies based on inventory, seasonality, time of day, or shopper’s past purchase history, among other factors.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-relativity">Pricing Relativity</h3>
<p>Pricing Relativity is the principle that people’s perception of prices are influenced by prices of other options they are offered. In his book Predictably Irrational, Dan Ariely describes The Economist’s perplexing pricing plan for subscriptions: “Web Only” for $59 a year, “Print Only” for $125 a year, and “Print and Web” for $125 a year. When asked to choose between “Web Only” and “Print and Web”, 68% chose “Web Only” and 32% chose “Print and Web”. However, when asked to choose among all three options, “Web Only” was chosen by 16%, and “Print and Web” was chosen by 84%, and nobody chose the added third option: “Print Only” at the same price as “Print and Web”. In this example, “Print Only” called the decoy package, and decoy packages have proved to be a powerful way to drive customers to higher priced products.</p>
